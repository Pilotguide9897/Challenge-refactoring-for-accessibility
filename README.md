# Challenge-1: Refactoring Code for a Marketing Agency to Improve Accessibility and Optimize for Search Engines.

## Description:
This project was completed as a learning exercise to teach about the process of refactoring code in compliance with user stories and acceptance criteria and was motivated by a desire to learn about accessibility standards and search engine optimization, factors that will be important when developing my own code, so that I may better achieve the goals of my clients. On a personal level, I enjoyed this challenge for the additional practice that it offered reviewing code. It is rather enjoyable exploring existing code to see how it works and how it is structured!

This project solves the problem of a code base that was poorly optimized for search engines due to poor adherence to accessibility standards. It solves this project by making changes to the existing code to better follow these standards, such as by introducing the use of semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure, contains alt attributes for images and icons, possesses a concise, descriptive title, and has heading attributes that fall in sequential order.

Completing this project I learned much about several semantic HTML elements that I did not know existed. For instance, I learned about the aside, figcaption, details, summary, time, and mark elements. In addition, I learned more about best practices for creating webpage titles and designing the alternative text for images. Finally, I learned more about CSS by editing my file to make sure that my application matches the mock-up provided. In this regard, I ran into a challenge for a time where the side information was dropping down below the rest of the content. After a time I was able to figure out that this had to do with an error that I had made when referencing one of the CSS elements.
